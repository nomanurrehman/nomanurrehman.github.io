>The Grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. What did they look like? ships? motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. And then, one day... - Kevin Flynn, Tron: Legacy

You must have known already but just in case, my name is Noman Ur Rehman. I am a web developer from Karachi, Pakistan currently in Kiel, Germany.

I have done most of my work in Ruby on Rails and Amazon Web Services but I am pretty good at PHP and Javascript too. Since I keep rambling about my technical skills in my blog posts, let me ease this space up a bit!

1. I love minimalism. I like the idea of owning only as much as required and as less as possible in the physical world. It actually starts from there but it can be applied to all other areas of your life.
2. I meditate daily as part of my morning routine. It has been a game changer for me.
3. I like open spaces. The trees, the forests, the list keeps going on.
4. Psychology is my favourite subject after Computer Science.
5. I am not on any of the social media platforms. Yes, let me say that again. I am not on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter...
6. Bookworm alert!

As a software developer, I am always looking to find a pattern/structure in everything. Sometimes, it works for the better, sometimes for the worse.
